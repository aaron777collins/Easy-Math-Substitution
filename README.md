# Easy Math Substitution

 A simple script to make typing math equations easier.


 When you toggle the special character substitution mode on (Press `), it will replace the following characters as such:

	a  ->  ∀
	t  ->  ∃
	e  ->  ∈
	=  ->  ≡
	!  ->  ¬
	s  ->  ⊆
	d  ->  ⊂
	x  ->  ⊇
	c  ->  ⊃
	z  ->  ⊄
	q  ->  ⊅
	r  ->  ∉
	o  ->  ∅
	-  ->  ⊖
	p  ->  ∎
	y  ->  ⊢
	h  ->  HELP SCREEN (this file)

	

To exit the program, type _

Thats it, enjoy!

Note:
Pressing ! may trigger your keyboard to switch to Latvian or some other language (depending on your hot-key)
If this happens, press your windows key (⊞ Win) + Space to switch back. (Or un-bind the hot-key)
Hope this solves any confusion!
